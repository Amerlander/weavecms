# WeaveCMS V3 Beta

## âœ¨ V3 Features & Improvements

- Custom Page Types (i.e. Content Types)
- Dynamic content fields (i.e. 'Site Field', 'Page Field', 'Page' to update entity page content referenced on other pages)
- Block/Starter Library
- Design system editor
- 10x faster build times bc every page gets generated on update, instead of all at once. 
- Conditional fields (to show/hide fields based on preceding field values)
- CSS-library compatibility (bootstrap, tailwind, bulma, etc. all work reliably using a standard cdn link). 
- UI/UX improvements
  - Drag pages to reorder them in the page list
  - Drag repeater items to reorder them
  - Drag-and-drop functionality improved for adding blocks to page & now works on mobile.
  - Block editor organized into code & content (i.e. fields & entries), UI improved.
  - On-page editing significantly improved.
